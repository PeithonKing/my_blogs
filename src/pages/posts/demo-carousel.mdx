# The Power of Grouping

When writing technical blogs, we often have a series of images that belong together. Perhaps it's a step-by-step tutorial, a comparison of results, or just a collection of moments from a project.

Traditionally, we'd stack them vertically, which kills the rhythm of the reading. Today, I'm introducing the **Carousel** component—a way to group these moments into a single, cohesive unit.

## The Activation Project

Here is a glimpse into the "Activation" project, showing the progression from initial thought to the final comparison. All these images are grouped to respect your viewport.

<Carousel
	images={[
		{
			src: '/my_blogs/images/activation1.png',
			alt: 'Initial Activation Function Plot',
			label: 'Phase 1: Visualizing the initial activation function curves.'
		},
		{
			src: '/my_blogs/images/bhab_na_ari.png',
			alt: 'Deep Thinking Process',
			label: "Phase 2: The 'Thinking' phase - debugging the model weights."
		},
		{
			src: '/my_blogs/images/LLaMA3vsChatGPT.png',
			alt: 'Benchmarking Llama 3 vs ChatGPT',
			label: 'Phase 3: Benchmarking results against industry standards.'
		},
		{
			src: '/my_blogs/images/brief_convo.png',
			alt: 'Brief Conversation Logs',
			label: 'Phase 4: Analyzing the conversation output quality.'
		},
		{
			src: '/my_blogs/images/activation_cover.png',
			alt: 'Final Project Cover',
			label: 'Phase 5: The final project cover art.'
		}
	]}
/>

## Why This Matters

By grouping these 5 images, we saved about **2000 pixels of vertical vertical scrolling**. The narrative remains uninterrupted.

Clicking any image above opens the immersive view, allowing you to inspect the details without losing your place in the article. This is the balance between _evidence_ and _story_.
